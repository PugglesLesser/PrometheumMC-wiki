#### <mark style="color:green;">**Q: Can I make (...) vanilla farm / structure?**</mark> **A: Yes, so long as it does not lag the server or become a detriment to other players, as per the rules.**

#### <mark style="color:green;">**Q: Can I build (...) at or near spawn?**</mark> ****A: Generally, as long as it is not an eyesore, you can build anything you want near spawn. When in doubt, ask a staff member!

#### <mark style="color:green;">**Q: Can I loot a base that looks like it hasn't been touched in a while / the player has stopped playing?**</mark> **A: Generally, stealing is a bannable offense.

Otherwise, do not touch things that aren't yours.**

<mark style="color:green;">**Q: (...) player is being really annoying / killing me repeatedly / stealing things. How can I report them?**</mark>\
**A: Create a ticket in the discord. One of the moderators or staff will help you out.**&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
<mark style="color:red;">**If you think you were griefed or stolen from, put your base coordinates, what was stolen/where was it, and who are the regular players at that base in the ticket!**</mark>
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
<mark style="color:red;">**If we determine that a player stole from you, they will be permanently banned. To avoid your teammates being permanently banned, I need a list of everyone who is allowed to access the base.**</mark>
{% endhint %}

<mark style="color:green;">**Q: (...) player is being somewhat annoying, but isn't directly harming anyone or breaking any rules, what can I do?**</mark>\ <mark style="color:green;">****</mark>**A: Firstly, talk to them! If you take issue with someone, tell them about it in a polite way that shows them how they can improve. If that doesn't work, you can **<mark style="color:red;">**/ignore**</mark>** them, which will block all incoming messages/requests from them. Attempting to bypass **<mark style="color:red;">**/ignore**</mark>** is a bannable offense, considered in the same way an exploit would be. If they are such a nuisance that they are contributing to a toxic environment, report them to staff and we will handle it.**

<mark style="color:green;">**Q: Is trading with other people's villagers considered stealing?**</mark>\
**A: It depends on the player/team who owns the villager, but generally trading with someone else's villagers **_**is considered stealing**_** and is a bannable offense. A good idea is to ask before you trade. The reason being that those villagers took many, **_**many**_** hours to roll up in some cases, so trading with them is essentially stealing from any potential profits they may make off having that villager.**
