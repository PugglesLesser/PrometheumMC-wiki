# PrometheumMC Wiki

## Welcome to PrometheumMC!

PrometheumMC is a vanilla+ server that builds a ton of extra mechanics on top of already familiar core Minecraft gameplay! All changes are completely optional and you don't even have to touch them if you don't want to. But, since you're already here, this is the wiki for all of PrometheumMC's mechanics!

Any donations are appreciated but not required! No gameplay perks are (or ever will be) given out to those who support the server, all benefits are purely cosmetic or affect everyone in game, not just one person.
