# Linked Nether Portals

#### &#x20;    On PrometheumMC, we do not use playerwarps, and /sethomes are intentionally very restricted since we want to keep at least some of the Vanilla feel, necessitating travel via external means.

&#x20;   That being said, a small improvement that has been made is that Nether Portals can now be linked. Any two portals, including those in the overworld and the nether and any combination thereof.&#x20;

### Material Requirements:

* 2x Nether Portals
* 2x Lodestones
* 2x Item Frames
* 2x Compasses

### Linking Two Nether Portals:

Place a lodestone in the corner of both nether portals, as shown here:

![2 Unlinked Portals](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (67).png>)

Use a compass on the lodestone of one of the portals, you will receive a Lodestone Compass that points to that portal:

![Lodestone Compass](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (121).png>)

Put an item frame on the other portal which the Lodestone Compass is not pointing to, then put said Lodestone Compass into the item frame.

![1-Way Linked Portal](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (98).png>)

Repeat the process for the other portal to establish 2-way travel between the two portals.

**Breaking the compass will break the linkage, do not break the compass unless you specifically **_**want**_** to disrupt travel.**&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Breaking any compass on public portals will be considered griefing/stealing and will result in a permanent ban, unless you are the owner of the portal or have express permission from the owner of the portal.**
