# Trade Shops

#### This server has a very simple chest shop system which does not use an economy whatsoever. All trading is done via real items and not a virtual currency system.

### How to create Trade Shops:

Write <mark style="color:red;">**\[Trade]**</mark> on a sign on a chest:

![Incomplete Trade Shop](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (49).png>)

Run <mark style="color:red;">**/ts addProduct**</mark>** ** while holding the item stack you would like to sell and looking at the sign of the incomplete Trade Shop. In this case, the product will be a Nether Star:

![Trade Shop with a product set](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (46).png>)

Run <mark style="color:red;">**/ts setCost**</mark>** ** while holding the item stack of what you would like the cost to be and looking at the sign. In this case, the cost will be 32x Diamond:

![Complete Trade Shop](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (68).png>)

Once you have set up your TradeShop, simply add stock of the product you wish to sell and the server will handle the rest! Make sure to come by to pick up any earnings frequently!

{% hint style="info" %}
**You can add more than one product and cost to each of you shops.**&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Do **<mark style="color:red;">**/ts what**</mark>** to see the full trade that is occurring while looking at a shop. This is especially useful when there are more than one product or cost, or if the item has a long name.**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**This supports all custom items as well, but each item might have slightly different NBT data, so it **_**may**_** only be able to sell the item you originally set as the cost/product.**
{% endhint %}
