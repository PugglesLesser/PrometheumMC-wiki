# Terralith

This server implements the Terralith 2.0: Overworld Evolved datapack by Starmute, it includes tons of new biomes, structures, and loot.&#x20;

The overworld is fully generated out to a 24,000 block radius from spawn, so no need to worry about lagging the server while exploring.

<mark style="color:red;">**/rtp**</mark> only takes you out to a fraction of the distance to the border, so there's plenty to explore that can't simply be explored by using commands.&#x20;
