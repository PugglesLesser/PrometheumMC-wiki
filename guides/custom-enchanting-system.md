# Custom Enchanting System

PrometheumMC features EcoEnchants, a plugin which drastically expands the amount of enchantments present in the game.&#x20;

There are too many to list, but if you want a full spreadsheet of all enchantments and rarities: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-3FOUnFoBj-AY2RKfnbfoso0kTCcsIfhNXCdzjilmEU/](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-3FOUnFoBj-AY2RKfnbfoso0kTCcsIfhNXCdzjilmEU/edit?usp=sharing)

Each enchantment has a different rarity, meaning that it will be less likely to show up in villager trades or in enchanting table trades.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Only 1 Special or Very-Special enchantment can be on each piece of gear at the same time, and you can only have 13 enchantments on a single piece of gear as well.**&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Although the anvil will say that an upgrade is **<mark style="color:red;">**Too Expensive!**</mark>**, it will still let you perform the upgrade provided you have enough levels. The required amount of levels to do so.**&#x20;

**There are Fabric mods that let you see the required levels, but the server has no vanilla way to tell you.**&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Enchantment Extractors:

Enchantment extractors can be used to take an enchantment off of an item, including curses.

**NOTE**: Currently due to an exploit, Extractors only work on items without CMD (Custom Model Data) so any item that has a custom texture will not work. This will be changed in the future.
