# Gilded Netherite

#### The final frontier of your item pathway... for now

To craft a single Gilded Netherite Ingot, you must first acquire an [Infernal Core](miscellaneous-materials.md#infernal-core) and a [Reinforced Netherite Ingot](miscellaneous-materials.md#reinforced-netherite), then simply combine them in a smithing table.

Gilded Netherite is infused with special properties that allow it to be constantly reforged, unlike most other gear and weapons.&#x20;
