# Getting Started

**Welcome to PrometheumMC!** This is a general guide for how to get going on the server and should help answer any basic questions or point you in the right direction!

### <mark style="color:green;">I just joined, help me!</mark>

{% hint style="warning" %}
**When you first join the server, you are teleported randomly** to even out the spread of players. A home will be set for you at the location you teleport to in case you die and need to get back there.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
If it is night time when you join, be aware that the server is set to **hard**, and there are many custom mobs that are itching to have a go at you. We recommend that you quickly find a place to hide, and ask players to skip the night.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

> Once you survive your first night, getting started is as simple as every other vanilla server, if not simpler! Punch a tree, craft an axe, and cause mass deforestation with [Timber](../guides/gameplay-tweaks-and-additions/vanillatweaks.md)!

### <mark style="color:green;">I survived the first few nights and have some gear, but...</mark>

> Now that you aren't afraid of anything that moves, you can start building up towards some better gear using all the systems on the server!

{% hint style="success" %}
Want to enchant that gear? Check out the [enchanting guide](../guides/custom-enchanting-system.md).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Want to get some cool weaponry? Check out the [Custom Swords](../guides/custom-items/swords.md) page.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**If you have any other questions about any of the systems, check the FAQ. If your question is not on there, feel free to ask in the** [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/2tpAPDMHBF)**! Our community will be happy to help you out!**
{% endhint %}

### **I have good gear, and I'm ready to take it to the next level!**

> Good job! Few people make it this far! Here's a few things you can do now:

{% hint style="success" %}
Collect boss shards from Servants! Guide on Servants and where to find them.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Craft those boss shards into a boss summon and fight the boss! It is recommended that  you fight it with other players, since you have a limited number of lives, and the bosses are _very_ difficult. Complete guide on bosses here.
