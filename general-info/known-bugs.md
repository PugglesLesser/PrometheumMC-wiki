* [ ] \#1: Bows (and other items) sometimes pop up with "this item is on cooldown!" with a 0 second cooldown.
* [ ] \#2: Enchant extractors cannot be used on items with custom textures
* [ ] \#3: Sometimes items with attack speed in both the offhand and the main hand can have the attack speed simply not work
* [ ] \#4: The attack speed stat on certain items can sometimes break when using the Dexterous enchantment.&#x20;
* [ ] \#5: Wither skeletons (for some reason) do not spawn or act like normal in wither skeleton farms.
* [ ] \#6: Telekinesis does not work with custom mob drops (no known fix on my end at this time, this is a plugin issue.)
