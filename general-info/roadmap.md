# Roadmap

Things that may be added or are being considered:

* [ ] Additional cosmetics for supporters and people who vote for the server (IN PROGRESS)
* [ ] Rework to the voting system
* [ ] Mob scaling in the Nether and the End
* [ ] Boosters for donations / voteparties (NOT p2w, these would be server-wide effects)
* [ ] Enchantment for double jumping (needs testing to see if this is possible)
* [ ] Fix to certain aspects of bosses (coming soon)
* [ ] Bosses level scaling per player in the fight
* [ ] Better lose/win system for boss fights
* [ ] Make artifact enchants not take up a max slot on gear
