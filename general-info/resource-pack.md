# Resource Pack

#### This server uses a custom resource pack, made by LesserPuggles, l3rosiah, Micah\_B12, and Hackogaming, with textures from Starmute for Incendium compatibility.&#x20;

Although the server will automatically send you the latest version of the resource pack, that can take up a lot of time depending on your connection and you device's performance.&#x20;

If you download the pack for yourself from the [#resource-pack channel in the discord](https://discord.gg/2tpAPDMHBF), you can then install it like a typical resource pack, then disable the server resource packs in the server browser.

If you need a guide on how to install Minecraft resource packs: [https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/Loading\_a\_resource\_pack](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/Loading\_a\_resource\_pack)&#x20;

To disable the server resource packs, simply go to your server browser, click PrometheumMC > edit (in the bottom left) > set "Server Resource Packs" to "Disabled".
