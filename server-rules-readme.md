# SERVER RULES - README



{% hint style="danger" %}
<mark style="color:red;">**Just because a rule is not listed here does not mean it doesn't exist. Generally, don't be a detriment to other players and you'll be fine. If you are going out of your way to be annoying, you will be removed from the server.**</mark>
{% endhint %}

1. No griefing, stealing, or generally being a detriment to other players. At all. Period. If you are caught doing this you will be permanently banned with no appeal process. Bans do not reset on season resets.&#x20;
2. Treat all players and staff with respect. I.e.: do not repeatedly ask for free stuff, don't constantly ask questions that can be easily answered on your own, don't pester staff or players to do things for you, etc.
3. Do not spam blocks all over community spaces, this includes but is not limited to: spawn, end island, nether hubs, etc.&#x20;
4. Do not be needlessly toxic to other members of the community.&#x20;
5. No hacking of any kind, this includes x-ray, baritone, macros, etc.&#x20;
6. No racist or anti-LGBTQIA+ behavior, keep this space is as inclusive as possible.
7. No abusing exploits. **THIS INCLUDES:** abusing unintended server mechanics for personal gain, god-mode exploits, dupe glitches, etc. If you see an exploit, report it to staff, **DO NOT ABUSE IT**, as this may result in punishment.&#x20;
8. PvP is allowed, but if a player has PvP toggled off and you go out of your way to kill them, this will be considered an exploit and you will be dealt with as needed.
9. If you unintentionally destroy something, or a creeper destroys something someone else made, leave a quick sign saying that it was an accident if the player is offline! Most people are fine with accidents!
